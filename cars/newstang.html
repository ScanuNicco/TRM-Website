			<h2>Facts and Info</h2>
			The newest addition to our fleet is a 1994 Cobra, which is currently engineless. We're planning to rebuild a Ford 302 that used to be in the Fox Body to remedy this issue. We've also acquired a Tremec Road Race T56 transmission and a set of Mahle pistons for the the 302. We're looking to begin work on the Cobra this quarter, so stay tuned for updates! While it will eventually become our road race / time attack car, we still have to put in a lot of work before it is race-ready!

			<h2>Moving Foward</h2>
			We need to buy a lot of stuff to turn the Cobra into a functioning race car and unfortenately the Student Government Association, which is our primary funding source, is planning to cut club budgets campus wide in the coming year. If you want to see this project reach its full potential, please consider donating to TRM.
