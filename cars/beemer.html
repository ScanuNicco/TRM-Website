			<h2>Facts and Info</h2>
			The Beemer is our 1988 BMW 325i powered by an LS1. We've built it with a focus on autocross racing, but its primary purpose in the team is to be a reliable and beginner friendly car for our newer members, particularly those who are less experienced with driving a manual. When we got it it still had the stock V6 but we blew that up with a turbo.
