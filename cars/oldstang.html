			<h2>Facts and Info</h2>
			Our 1984 Fox Body Mustang is the oldest TRM car that's still in used. We've built it with a focus on drag racing, and there's nothing on this car that we haven't worked on at some point. It's currently powered by a Ford 351 Cleveland V8. The Cleveland is a realtively new addition and we've only made one pass with it, so we're excited to see what it can do with a bit more refinement! We've also installed a built C4 transmission with trans brake, a line lock, a racing dash and guages with a shift light, and Hoosier drag slicks.
			<h2>Safety</h2>
			We've safety is important on our team, so we've installed many safety enhancing systems on this car. These include a full roll cage, 5-point racing harnesses, a fuel-cell with an enclosure, an external battery cutoff switch, and a fire supression system.
