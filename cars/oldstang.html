			<h2>Facts and Info</h2>
			Our 1984 Fox Body Mustang is the oldest TRM car that's still in used. There's nothing on this car that we haven't worked on at some point. It's currently powered by a Ford 351 Cleveland V8. The Cleveland is a realtively new addition and we are excited to see what it can do on a track! We've also installed a roll cage, trans brake, line lock, and a shift light. We've built it with a focus on drag racing.
