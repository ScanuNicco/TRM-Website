	<h2>Who we are</h2>
	<p>Team Rose Motorsports provides an outlet for members to apply engineering skills learned in the classroom in a focused automotive environment. Hands-on automotive repair, design and fabrication experience through the maintenance and preparation of racecars is central to the team.Â Additionally, members can build their knowledge of automobiles and high-performance driving through operating these vehicles in sanctioned competitions in the surrounding area.</p><br>

	<h2>Consider Contributing to TRM</h2>
	<p>TRM needs a lot of tools, parts, and equipment to stay competitive, and the cost of turning the Cobra into a functioning race car will be signifigant. Unfortenately, our primary funding source, the Student Government Association, is planning to substantially cut club budgets campus wide in the coming year. If you want to see this project reach its full potential, please consider donating to TRM.</p>
