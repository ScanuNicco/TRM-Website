	<h2>Success Over the Years</h2>
	<p>Scotbotics is now more than a decade old, and we were the oldest team in 2019’s FIRST regional competition.
<br><br>
Considering that we're student run and that we generally run on a tight budget, Scotbotics has shown incredible success since our founding in 2009. Scotbotics has attended the FIRST Tech Challenge world championships twice-- once in Atlanta during our rookie year for the 2009-2010 game <i>HotShot!</i> and again in St. Louis for the 2012-2013 game <i>Ring It Up!</i>-- and we also attended the very first Western Super Regionals in the 2013-2014 game <i>Block Party!</i>
<br><br>
2016 was also a successful year for Scotbotics, because we advanced to regionals once again. 
<br><br>
Most recently in 2018, Scotbotics attended California's FIRST regional competition. This was because not only did Scotbotics succeed in qualifying tournaments but we also qualified early in the season as a result of hosting a competition in our home town. We attended regionals along with one of Piedmont's first-year teams named Hypercube. Although we placed in the middle of the pack and did not go onto final rounds or accompany another team (unlike Hypercube, who did go on accompanying another team but also did not advance to FIRST's world championships), we were the highest-placed team from Piedmont in the primary round of regionals.</p>
