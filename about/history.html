            <p>Team Rose Motorsports began back in 1978 when GM donated a brand new Buick Regal to Rose-Hulman. The club was called Rose-Hulman Racing back then and focused on modifying the Buick for drag racing. Members were able to extract more than 500 horsepower from its turbo V6. <a title="Buick Regal" href="../cars/regal.html">You can read more about our Buick Regal here</a>.</p><br>
            <p>Beginning in the mid 80s, Rose-Hulman Racing switched focus to the SAE Mini-Baja competition. They built small off-road carts powered by a competition-standard Briggs &amp; Stratton engine. This format didn&#8217;t last long, however, and the team picked up Formula SAE in 1987.</p><br>
            <p>A much more rigorous program, Formula SAE demanded that clubs build cart-style racers that were judged on their production potential as an amateur weekend racer. RHR continued competing in FSAE through 1992 but a lack of continued interest and dwindling membership caused the Student Government Association to revoke its club status shortly thereafter.</p><br>
            <p>In the fall of 2000, a group of mechanically-minded students worked to revise RSR&#8217;s format. By the following year, Team Rose Motorsports was an official club again. Our first car was a 1985 Mazda RX-7 that raced in SCCA Solo II autocrosses. It stayed with the club for exactly ten years before it was replaced by the BMW. <a title="RX-7" href="../cars/rx7.html">You can read more about the RX-7 here</a>.</p><br>

            <p>Team Rose Motorsports acquired our second car in the fall of 2002. Hoping to expand past just autocross, we bought a 1984 Ford Mustang for use at the drag strip. Having gone through many different iterations of competition and performance, the Mustang is still with the club today. <a title="Mustang" href="../cars/oldstang.html">Visit our Mustang page for more info</a>.</p><br>
            <p>In the Spring of 2005, two TRM members drove to New Jersey to pick up a dragster and trailer for the club. After 1,527 miles and a flat tire, Team Rose Motorsports had a new project. Due to the cost of licensing drivers, the dragster was sold in 2008. <a title="Dragster" href="../cars/dragster.html">You can read more about our dragster here</a>.</p><br>
            <p>At the end of 2007 a Porsche 914 was donated to the club. Converted in the 80s to a dedicated racer and neglected in a barn for more than a decade, TRM worked to restore it to working condition. Initially conceived as a turbocharged E85 autocrosser, it remained stationary for years before its air-cooled Volkswagen engine ran again. All these years later, it is finally moving closer to that initial conception. <a title="Porsche" href="../cars/porsche.html">Check out our Porsche page for more</a>.</p><br>
            <p>During the summer of 2011 following the loss of the RX-7, Team Rose Motorsports purchased an E30 BMW 325is and returned to having a three-car stable. It was supposed to remain a stock &#8220;beginner&#8221; autocross car, but after three years of extreme reliability the club decided that it should be more fun. <a title="BMW" href="../cars/beemer.html">The story continues on our BMW page</a>.</p><br>
